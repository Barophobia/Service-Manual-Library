<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
    I built this with because I am a tech engineer who is always struggling to find the latest Service manuals for the range of products I support so I guess other people do as well, maybe. I think everyone should have the right to repair their goods and this was made supporting that.


### Built With

* Python
* PyQT5
* QDarkstyle
